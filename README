Running
=======

You can run your starter application with:

  python sample.py

Please read sample.py carefully, it contains detailed information
in the comments.

Installation
============

The full source for the google-api-python-client library is included
in this starter application, but the library has not been installed on your
system. That means that this sample will run from within the unzipped
directory, but from nowhere else.

The easiest way to install the client library into your system is by running easy_install:

  easy_install --upgrade google-api-python-client

You might need to add a 'sudo' to the beginning of that command depending on your platform.
If you don't have easy_install you can get it by installing the setuptools package.


Documentation
=============

The documentation for the google-api-python-client library is avialable here:

   https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started
